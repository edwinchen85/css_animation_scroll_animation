# CSS Animation - Scroll Animations

In this CSS Animation project, we will animate header and image elements when these elements are scrolled into viewport. Instead of using scroll listener to detect whether elements have scrolled into view, we utilize requestAnimationFrame feature to perform this job as it is more efficient. We add a class hook to the targeted elements when they have scrolled into view. Then we define style properties to animate the elements.
